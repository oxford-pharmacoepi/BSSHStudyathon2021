# BSSHStudyathon2021 8th September 2021, Oxford
An international study characterising patients undergoing surgery for wrist arthritis and its outcomes

There are 3 elements to this studyathon:
1. Appraising the literature for what is already known within systematic review (led by researchers from NDORMS and University of Leeds)
2. Assessing the outcomes of proximal row carpectomy - patient reported pain and hand function (led by Xpert clinics and Erasmus MC)
3. Characterising the patients proceeding to intervention for wrist arthritis, and assessing the serious adverse events associated with intervention (led by the OHDSI community)

*All 3 parts aim to contribute equally address the central research question and support each other through heterogeneity*

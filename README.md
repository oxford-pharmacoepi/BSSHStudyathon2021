# BSSHStudyathon2021 8th September 2021, Oxford
An international study characterising patients undergoing surgery for wrist arthritis and its outcomes

There are 3 elements to this studyathon:
1. Appraising the literature for what is already known within systematic review
2. Assessing the outcomes of proximal row carpectomy - patient reported pain and hand function
3. Characterising the patients proceeding to intervention for wrist arthritis, and assessing the serious adverse events associated with intervention

All 3 parts aim to address the central research question and support each other through heterogeneity
